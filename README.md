# 8 Week SQL Challenge

Here I store my solutions to Danny Ma's 8 Week SQL Challenge!

In 2021, Danny released a series of case studies designed to provide a fun way to practice SQL. The case studies are free to access, and a lot of community solutions are available online. However, to access the official solutions you need to sign up to Danny's Seroius SQL course, containing also additional SQL content.

I love the concept of this challenge and appreciate all the effort Danny has put into it! Thank you so much!
